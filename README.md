## Project Supervision
Under the supervision of **Pr. Hosni**.

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecommunications industry, where companies face annual churn rates of 15-25%. The analysis focuses on predicting which customers are likely to discontinue services, helping companies focus retention efforts on high-risk customers.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze the percentage distribution of churned vs retained customers
- Identify patterns in customer churn based on gender
- Understand service type preferences among churning customers
- Determine most profitable service types and features
- Build predictive models for churn detection

## Content Structure
1. Introduction
   - What is Customer Churn?
   - How can customer churn be reduced?

2. Data Analysis
   - Loading and understanding the data
   - Missing value analysis
   - Data manipulation and preprocessing
   - Feature engineering

3. Exploratory Data Visualization
